# TownSim: agent-based city evolution for naturalistic road network generation [ðŸ“–](zotero://select/library/items/D8FHV56L)

> [!abstract]-
> 
> We describe an agent-based city evolution algorithm creating road networks over time, and explore several approaches for analyzing the malleability of the algorithm to exposed parameters. In addition to qualitatively assessing the generated content, we look at the directionality, connectivity, and curvature of the generated road networks.
