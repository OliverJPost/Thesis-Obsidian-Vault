# Authoring Hierarchical Road Networks [ðŸ“–](zotero://select/library/items/UWULHXUZ)

> [!abstract]-
> 
> We present a procedural method for generating hierarchical road networks connecting cities, towns and villages over large terrains. Our approach relies on an original geometric graph generation algorithm based on a non-Euclidean metric combined with a path merging algorithm that creates junctions between the different types of roads. Unlike previous work, our method allows high level user control by manipulating the density and the pattern of the network. The geometry of the highways, primary and secondary roads as well as the interchanges and intersections are automatically created from the graph structure by instantiating generic parameterized models.

### Initial thoughts:
- Very much focussed on high level road layouts between towns/cities. Out of scope
- Perhaps some useful techniques/information for road network generation in general?
