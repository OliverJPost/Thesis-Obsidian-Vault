# GHS-FUA R2019A - GHS functional urban areas, derived from GHS-UCDB R2019A, (2015), R2019A [ðŸ“–](zotero://select/library/items/D6U9IPCJ)

> [!abstract]-
> 
> The spatial dataset delineates the boundaries of Function Urban Areas (FUA) of Urban Centres in 2015. The automatic procedure developed in collaboration with OECD estimates for each populated cells at 1 km (obtained from GHS-POP R2019A) the probability to belong to a Functional Urban Area of a given Urban Centre (GHS-UCDB R2019A). Pixels with probability higher than a calibrated threshold are combined to form the eFUA extent and polygonized to obtain the boundaries.
