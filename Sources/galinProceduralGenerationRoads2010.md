# Procedural Generation of Roads [ðŸ“–](zotero://select/library/items/WQETEQST)

> [!abstract]-
> 
> In this paper, we propose an automatic method for generating roads based on a weighted anisotropic shortest path algorithm. Given an input scene, we automatically create a path connecting an initial and a final point. The trajectory of the road minimizes a cost function that takes into account the different parameters of the scene including the slope of the terrain, natural obstacles such as rivers, lakes, mountains and forests. The road is generated by excavating the terrain along the path and instantiating generic parameterized models.

### Initial thoughts:
- Even though it only focusses on rural landscapes, it's full of math and cost functions that could be very useful
