# GHS-BUILT-H R2023A - GHS building height, derived from AW3D30, SRTM30, and Sentinel2 composite (2018) [ðŸ“–](zotero://select/library/items/TCIVZTMU)

> [!abstract]-

> The spatial raster dataset depicts the spatial distribution of the building heights as extracted from the filtering of a composite of global digital elevation models (DEM) and the filtering of satellite imagery using linear regression techniques. The used input DEMs are the ALOS World 3D - 30m (AW3D30, 2006-2011) and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 30m (SRTM30, 2000). The building heights extracted from these sources are updated using the support of the shadow markers extracted from the Sentinel2 image data composite of the year 2018 (GHS-composite-S2 R2020A). The data is published at 100m resolution in World Mollweide (ESRI:54009). The building height information are summarized to the grid cell as Average of the Gross Building Height (AGBH) and Average of the Net Building Height (ANBH). The AGBH is expressed in terms of cubic meters per surface unit (volumetric built density), while the ANBH is expressed in terms of meters.
