## Permanent notes
### Initial thoughts:
- Proposes a better algorithm based on [[parishProceduralModelingCities]]

### Relations:
- [[parishProceduralModelingCities]]

### Summary
Makes the L-system into an algorithm that is actually easy to read and understandable. Original L-system takes ages to understand, and I don't understand why they use strings and string formatting in the first place. Author also claims his implementation is much faster than the original, but I don't see exactly where the speed is increased a lot. The author already admits that the `localConstraints` and `globalGoals` functions are probably the speed bottleneck anyway, and this post doesn't change those at all.

Final algorithm:
```pseudocode
initialize priority queue Q with a single entry:
     r(0,ra,qa)

initialize segment list S to empty

until Q is empty
    pop smallest r(t,ra,qa) from Q
        compute (nqa, state) = localConstraints(qa)
        if (state == SUCCEED) {
            add segment(ra) to S
            addZeroToThreeRoadsUsingGlobalGoals(Q, t+1, qa,ra)
```
