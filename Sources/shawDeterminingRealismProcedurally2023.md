# Determining Realism ofÂ Procedurally Generated City Road Networks [ðŸ“–](zotero://select/library/items/ES8XLIIE)

> Cities are both expansive and relatively homogeneous, making them well suited to procedural generation. Road networks are one of the most important components of generated cities, and rely on both exogenous and endogenous factors such as the environment and population. These factors significantly affect the characteristics of the generated city, and thus the evaluation of the realism or plausibility of the generated city is a non-trivial task. Previous work largely relied of subjective assessments of realism.

- Unclear how well it actually measures quality, seems to use some fairly simple metrics
- Of course better than manual judging
