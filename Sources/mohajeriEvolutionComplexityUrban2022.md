# The Evolution and Complexity of Urban Street Networks [ðŸ“–](zotero://select/library/items/93MNZ9HG)

> [!abstract]-
> 
> Street networks are one of the very few types of complex networks where the history of the network can be traced over long periods of time. In this chapter, the authors introduce methods for quantifying the geometric characteristics of street networks and analyse the details of the evolution of the networks of Sheffield (UK), Khorramabad (Iran), and Kerman (Iran) over tens to hundreds of years. The selected cities for a quantitative study of evolving street networks are Sheffield and Iranian cities. One reason for these selections is the availability of historical data and geographic information system data sets for their street networks, which makes a detailed analysis of their respective street network evolutions possible. The methods described focus on the following aspects of the street networks: street orientation, street length, and the Shannonâ€“Gibbs entropy measure of the orientation and length distributions.
