# GHS-BUILT-V R2023A - GHS built-up volume grids derived from joint assessment of Sentinel2, Landsat, and global DEM data, multitemporal (1975-2030) [ðŸ“–](zotero://select/library/items/WJ6WDXA4)

> [!abstract]-
> 
> The spatial raster dataset depicts the distribution of the built-up (BU) volume estimates between 1975 and 2030 in 5 years intervals and two functional use components a) the total BU volume and b) the non-residential (NRES) BU volume. The data is made by projection of the assessment of the average building height in the year 2018 (GHS_BUILT_H_ANBH_E2018_GLOBE_R2023A_54009_100_V1_0) assumed as constant in the 100m resolution cell, to the multitemporal built-up surface estimates (GHS-BUILT-S_GLOBE_R2023A, GHS-BUILT-S_NRES_GLOBE_R2023A).
