### Initial thoughts:
- Based on [[parishProceduralModelingCities]], but with a lot more info on how it's implemented.

### Relations:


### Summary
Focusses very much on L-systems and how they're used for the road generation. Seems to offer worse results than [[parishProceduralModelingCities]] and nothing extra that could be of use.
