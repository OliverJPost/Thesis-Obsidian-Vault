# Interactive Modeling of City Layouts using Layers of Procedural Content [📖](zotero://select/library/items/JRQ9QMBV)

> [!abstract]-
> 
> In this paper, we present new solutions for the interactive modeling of city layouts that combine the power of procedural modeling with the ﬂexibility of manual modeling. Procedural modeling enables us to quickly generate large city layouts, while manual modeling allows us to hand-craft every aspect of a city. We introduce transformation and merging operators for both topology preserving and topology changing transformations based on graph cuts. In combination with a layering system, this allows intuitive manipulation of urban layouts using operations such as drag and drop, translation, rotation etc. In contrast to previous work, these operations always generate valid, i.e., intersection-free layouts. Furthermore, we introduce anchored assignments to make sure that modiﬁcations are persistent even if the whole urban layout is regenerated.

### Initial thoughts:
- Allows editing of existing street layouts while updating the surrounding area to keep it valid 
- Very useful but looks complicated to implement and editing is probably out of scope of the thesis
