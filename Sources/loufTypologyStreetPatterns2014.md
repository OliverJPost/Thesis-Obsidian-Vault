# A typology of street patterns [üìñ](zotero://select/library/items/W55NYTW2)

> [!abstract]-
> 
> We propose a quantitative method to classify cities according to their street pattern. We use the conditional probability distribution of shape factor of blocks with a given area, and define what could constitute the `fingerprint' of a city. Using a simple hierarchical clustering method, these fingerprints can then serve as a basis for a typology of cities. We apply this method to a set of 131 cities in the world, and at an intermediate level of the dendrogram, we observe 4 large families of cities characterized by different abundances of blocks of a certain area and shape. At a lower level of the classification, we find that most European cities and American cities in our sample fall in their own sub-category, highlighting quantitatively the differences between the typical layouts of cities in both regions. We also show with the example of New York and its different Boroughs, that the fingerprint of a city can be seen as the sum of the ones characterising the different neighbourhoods inside a city. This method provides a quantitative comparison of urban street patterns, which could be helpful for a better understanding of the causes and mechanisms behind their distinct shapes.

## Permanent notes
### Initial thoughts:
- Very small set of indicators
	- Block area
	- Block shape (area/circumscribed circle area)
- Results not great, puts New York in same category as Paris
- Gives some good quotes
- Can be used as a starting point

### Relations:

- & A major shortcoming of existing classifications is that they are based on the street network. This is problematic for two different reasons. First, there is no unambiguous, purely geometrical definition of what a street is: [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AYV7SLT7?page=2&annotation=AKXEMFEP) 
- & Second, it seems that what is perceived by the human eye of a city map is not coming from streets but from the distribution of the shape, area and disposition of blocks [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AYV7SLT7?page=2&annotation=433YCNJ4) 
- & surface area A of a block [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AYV7SLT7?page=2&annotation=EVHXG88F)

- & In Europe, the division is usually clear between the historical center and the more recent surburbs (a striking example of such differences is the Eixample neighbourhood in Barcelona, very distinct from other areas of the city) [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AYV7SLT7?page=5&annotation=P443EFQ6) 
- & What is lacking at this point is a systematic, quantitative way to identify and distinguish different neighbourhoods, [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AYV7SLT7?page=8&annotation=DEMXBLNN) 
- & similar patterns might span several administrative regions, or a given administrative division might host very distinct neighbourhoods. <br />
A further step in the classification would thus be to find a method to extract these neighbourhoods, and integrate the spatial correlations between different types of neighbourhoods [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AYV7SLT7?page=8&annotation=VIW4ZLTU)
