# Procedural Urban Modeling in Practice [ðŸ“–](zotero://select/library/items/9I4RL67T)

> [!abstract]-
> 
> Film and game studios can no longer meet audience demand for visual content by increasing production budgets. Instead they are turning to procedural modeling, particularly for modeling cities. The authors review procedural modeling, examine the CityEngine tool, and study the use of procedural urban modeling in Electronic Arts' Need for Speed games.
