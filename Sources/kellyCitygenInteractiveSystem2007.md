# Citygen: An Interactive System for Procedural City Generation [ðŸ“–](zotero://select/library/items/WSPM5NFT)

> [!abstract]-
> 
> Contemporary 3D games are often situated within large urban environments. This necessitates a time-consuming and expensive content creation process involving the modelling of vast amounts of geometric detail: including terrain, roads, buildings, and other associated features. We present a system called Citygen that aims to automate as much of this as possible by employing procedural generation methods to rapidly create the urban geometry typical of a modern city. Procedural methods have long been used within the graphics and game development communities to generate natural phenomena such as plants and trees. We employ these methods to generate the underlying road networks that form the structure of cities and urban neighbourhoods. These road networks are automatically mapped to any supplied terrain model, and adapt themselves to the specific geometry of the underlying terrain. Building footprints are automatically extracted from the resulting model and buildings can then be inserted either procedurally or by hand. Our system is unique in that it is designed to allow developers hands-on interactive control over the generation process. We achieve this by providing an interface allowing the user to directly manipulate geometric elements such as road intersection nodes, and to directly control and specify many aspects of the procedural generation. The results are updated in real time, thus facilitating an interactive design process.
