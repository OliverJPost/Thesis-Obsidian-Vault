# A Procedural Generation Method of Urban Roads Based on OSM [ðŸ“–](zotero://select/library/items/YL7Z7DEK)

> [!abstract]-
> 
> The cost of manually creating large-scale urban road 3D assets for a virtual city is prohibitively expensive, and there is no road environment that corresponds to real geographic space. Thus, the approach of procedural modelling has received a lot of attention. In this paper, we propose a procedural generation method for urban roads. By preprocessing the OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, we construct a network of urban roads with topological relations, and instantiate the road 3D models with procedural syntax. Furthermore, we use several procedural generation methods that have been proposed to create street furniture. The method proposed in this paper produces a coherent and robust generation framework for urban roads that contains traffic information, road surfaces, and street components. The experiment demonstrates that this method is able to create realistic cityscapes based on real world locations. Moreover, the form of 3D assets created by the method can be easily modified through parameters, making it possible to create endless variations. Compared with the previous approach, our urban road generation framework can greatly enhance modelling efficiency.

### Initial thoughts:
- Probably out of scope. Road surface generation should be done with a utility, this paper only gives theory (their workflow is implemented in Houdini)

### Relations:
