# A Geometric Classification of World Urban Road Networks [📖](zotero://select/library/items/WQTHLJVR)

> [!abstract]-
> 
> This article presents a method to uncover universal patterns and similarities in the urban road networks of the 80 most populated cities in the world. To that end, we used degree distribution, link length distribution, and intersection angle distribution as topological and geometric properties of road networks. Moreover, we used ISOMAP, a nonlinear dimension reduction technique, to better express variations across cities, and we used K-means to cluster cities. Overall, we uncovered one universal pattern between the number of nodes and links across all cities and identiﬁed ﬁve classes of cities. Gridiron Cities tend to have many 90◦ angles. Long Link Cities have a disproportionately high number of long links and include mostly Chinese cities that developed towards the end of the 20th century. Organic Cities tend to have short links and more non-90 and 180◦ angles; they also include relatively more historical cities. Hybrid Cities tend to have both short and long links; they include cities that evolved both historically and recently. Finally, Mixed Cities exhibit features from all other classes. These ﬁndings can help transport planners and policymakers identify peer cities that share similar characteristics and use their characteristics to craft tailored transport policies.

- @ each city was expressed by a vector with 44 values (16 for degrees, 10 for link lengths, and 18 for street angles). [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BVXECANL?page=6&annotation=BAVQPAPR) 
- @ Because most clustering techniques utilize Euclidean distance measures to identify clusters, when the data dimension increases, the distance between data points in high dimensional space becomes more or less uniform [65]. Therefore, to better express the differences between cities, it is often preferable to reduce the dimensionality of the vector used while preserving the inherent features of the road networks. For this, we first transformed the raw data using ISOMAP [66], which is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique. ISOMAP was selected thanks to its ability to preserve the variation in the original data in the transformed data. Additionally, since the data are probability distributions, any nonlinear behavior would not be captured by linear dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). <br />

- $ This result suggests the presence of a universal mechanism that directs the road network growth. In other words, this relationship shows that on average each node is connected to 1.33 links, and this trend is found to be universally true for all cities regardless of when the road network was developed [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BVXECANL?page=8&annotation=4SZHER7P)
