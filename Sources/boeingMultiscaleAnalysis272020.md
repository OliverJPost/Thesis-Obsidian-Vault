# A multi-scale analysis of 27,000 urban street networks: Every US city, town, urbanized area, and Zillow neighborhood [ðŸ“–](zotero://select/library/items/LNMXF7D4)

> [!abstract]-
> 
> OpenStreetMap offers a valuable source of worldwide geospatial data useful to urban researchers. This study uses the OSMnx software to automatically download and analyze 27,000 US street networks from OpenStreetMap at metropolitan, municipal, and neighborhood scalesâ€”namely, every US city and town, census urbanized area, and Zillow-defined neighborhood. It presents empirical findings on US urban form and street network characteristics, emphasizing measures relevant to graph theory, transportation, urban design, and morphology such as structure, connectedness, density, centrality, and resilience. In the past, street network data acquisition and processing have been challenging and ad hoc. This study illustrates the use of OSMnx and OpenStreetMap to consistently conduct street network analysis with extremely large sample sizes, with clearly defined network definitions and extents for reproducibility, and using nonplanar, directed graphs. These street networks and measures data have been shared in a public repository for other researchers to use.

- & studies frequently oversimplify to planar or undirected primal graphs for tractability [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3GLC7CA2?page=3&annotation=MIGLFZUG) 
- @ primal, nonplanar, weighted multidigraphs with possible self-loops [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3GLC7CA2?page=3&annotation=2LLZPCLK) 
- & While the metropolitan scale captures the emergent character of the wider regionâ€™s complex system, and the municipal scale captures planning decisions made by a single city government, the neighborhood best represents the scale of individual urban design interventions into the urban form. Further, this scale more commonly reflects individual designs, eras, and paradigms in street network development than the â€˜â€˜many hands, many erasâ€™â€™ evolution of form at larger scales. [(p. 12)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3GLC7CA2?page=12&annotation=NMG6NBEX) 
- & can filter the data set to examine only large neighborhoods (i.e. with area greater than the median value across the data set [(p. 12)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3GLC7CA2?page=12&annotation=IZT5HBTJ)
