> Timely and reliable land-use maps are of great importance in urban planning and environmental monitoring. With the rich spatial structure information, very high resolution (VHR) imagery is an important data source for identifying complex urban land use. However, the existing scene datasets and land-use mapping products based on VHR images have the following three problems: 1) accurate geographic boundaries of urban land parcels are lacking; 2) the category systems are inconsistent with the definitions in urban land use; and 3) it is difficult to achieve efficient and fully automated mapping in multiple cities. To tackle these problems, the GlobalUrbanNet-based automatic multi-city mapping and analysis (GAMMA) framework is proposed in this article. The GAMMA framework is made up of the GlobalUrbanNet (GUN) dataset, the multi-city fully automatic urban land-use mapping (AutoULUM) method, and the analysis of urban development patterns. Specifically, the large-scale 42-category fine-grained VHR urban land-use datasetâ€”the GUN datasetâ€”was constructed to deal with the above global urban land-use mapping problems, which contains 1,846,151 samples and 42 land-use categories covering six continents. The GUN dataset samples with land-use semantics and parcel boundaries were generated automatically based on the open-source area of interest (AOI) data from OpenStreetMap (OSM). In addition, the AutoULUM method is proposed to automate the process of OSM road network rectification and land parcel generation. On this basis, efficient and complete multi-city land-use maps can be produced using the GUN-pretrained scene classification models. To establish a benchmark for urban land-use classification, the representative urban land-use classification methods were evaluated on the GUN dataset. For further application, eight megacities from six continents were selected for automatic land-use mapping and analysis, i.e., Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chengdu in Asia, Helsinki in Europe, Nairobi in Africa, New York in North America, Rio de Janeiro in South America, and Sydney in Oceania. The results show that the models trained on the proposed GUN dataset have good generalizability in global urban areas, the AutoULUM method achieves efficient and fully automatic land-use mapping, and the GAMMA framework will help boost the coordinated development of multiple cities around the world.
