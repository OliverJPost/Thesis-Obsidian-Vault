# Assessing Patch Shape in Landscape Mosaics [ðŸ“–](zotero://select/library/items/R3WW3BEZ)

> [!abstract]-
> 
> Th:e shapes of patches in classified landscape digital images can be characterized, for each land-cover class of interest, by quantifying the spatial contiguity and clustering of the pixels within each patch. In a study of the Finger Lakes National Forest in central New York State, patch-level contiguity and clustering indices were used in conjunction with the fractal dimension to assess changes, between 1938 and 1988, in forest patch morphology. Contiguity and clustering data may prove most useful, for landscape planning and management decision-making, however, as layers in raster geographic information systems (GI%).
