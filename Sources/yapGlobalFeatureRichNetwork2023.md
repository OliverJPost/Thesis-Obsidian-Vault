# A Global Feature-Rich Network Dataset of Cities and Dashboard for Comprehensive Urban Analyses [ðŸ“–](zotero://select/library/items/Y889UC9Q)

> [!abstract]-
> 
> Urban network analytics has become an essential tool for understanding and modeling the intricate complexity of cities. We introduce the Urbanity data repository to nurture this growing research field, offering a comprehensive, open spatial network resource spanning 50 major cities in 29 countries worldwide. Our workflow enhances OpenStreetMap networks with 40 + high-resolution indicators from open global sources such as street view imagery, building morphology, urban population, and points of interest, catering to a diverse range of applications across multiple fields. We extract streetscape semantic features from more than four million street view images using computer vision. The datasetâ€™s strength lies in its thorough processing and validation at every stage, ensuring data quality and consistency through automated and manual checks. Accompanying the dataset is an interactive, web-based dashboard we developed which facilitates data access to even non-technical stakeholders. Urbanity aids various GeoAI and city comparative analyses, underscoring the growing importance of urban network analytics research.

### Initial thoughts:
- Dataset that combines data from many sources into a ==network== of edges and nodes.
- Not only offers combined data, but is thoroughly checked for quality
- Also has a Python tool "Urbanity" to request data of any place?
- ~ What things are available exactly? Both in their own datasets and the ones downloadable with the tool. 
	- Seems to have:
		- footprint statistics per street + amount of buildings
		- population statistics per street
		- general building function count per street (commercial, healthcare etc.)
- & The `ubanity.building` module has functions to get footprints from Overture and OSM
- & The tool can be used to download both network and footprint data from anywhere!
- & It seems to combine data from many sources. It can for example merge OSM and Overture building footprints

### Relations:
- Uses:
