## Permanent notes
### Initial thoughts:
- Read to get a broad overview of what Morphology is about and what other works are out there
- Chapter 2 divides the city into "the natural context" #terrain , "the streets system" #roads, "the plots system" #plots and "the buildings system" #buildings 
- Chapters 3, 4, and 5 describe the history of the city
- Chapter 6.1 goes into related references and what they say about morphology
- [ ] Check out these references, see if they're worth studying
- Chapter 6.2 describes different approaches: Historico-Geographical Approach, Process Typological Approach, Space Syntax, Spatial Analysis, and New Perspectives

### Relations:
- Cities described:
	- [[Istanbul]]
	- [[Tokyo]]
	- [[New York]]
	- [[Marrakesh]]
	- [[Porto]]
- [[Morphology]]
