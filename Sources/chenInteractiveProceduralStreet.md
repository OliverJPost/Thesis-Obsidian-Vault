# Interactive Procedural Street Modeling [📖](zotero://select/library/items/BPWVJF56)

> [!abstract]-
> 
> This paper addresses the problem of interactively modeling large street networks. We introduce an intuitive and ﬂexible modeling framework in which a user can create a street network from scratch or modify an existing street network. This is achieved through designing an underlying tensor ﬁeld and editing the graph representing the street network. The framework is intuitive because it uses tensor ﬁelds to guide the generation of a street network. The framework is ﬂexible because it allows the user to combine various global and local modeling operations such as brush strokes, smoothing, constraints, noise and rotation ﬁelds. Our results will show street networks and three-dimensional urban geometry of high visual quality.
