# RODGEN: an interactive interface for road network generation [ðŸ“–](zotero://select/library/items/ZLYAI4W6)

> [!abstract]-
> 
> We present RODGEN, an interactive, graphical user interface for generating road networks that adopts the growth-based model. The first step in the generation process is to construct the backbone of the network by either choosing between a grid-based and a ringbased predefined topology or allowing the users to define a custom one. The backbone divides the space into a number of areas, called neighborhoods. The user can populate neighborhoods either by importing existing road networks or adding roads by hand. Besides generating road networks, our interface also provides a platform for analysis. For this purpose, we employ a general-purpose graph analytics library, which allows the users to compute graph statistics, perform connectivity analysis and execute basic routing tasks.

### Initial thoughts:
- Looks like the results are very unrealistic. It just takes existing road layouts and puts them in weird quadrants
### Relations:
