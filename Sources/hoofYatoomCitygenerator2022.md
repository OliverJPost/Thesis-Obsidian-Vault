## Permanent notes
### Initial thoughts:
- JS implementation of [[parishProceduralModelingCities]]

### Relations:


### Summary
- ! Has Z and X as horizontal, and Y as vertical
- Starts with 2 road segments from 0,0,0 (0,1,0?) origin. One in positive z, one negative z
- Has implementation, but no real innovative insights. Roads only branch if there is enough population at THAT spot, which wouldnt work for main roads. Determines population based route by comparing 0 dgree angle with 1 single random angle
