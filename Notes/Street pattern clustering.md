# Street pattern clustering


[[Street pattern clustering experiment 1]]

#### Chosen features
- Block [[Equivalent Rectangular Index]] as suggested by [[loufTypologyStreetPatterns2014]]
- Block [[CircularCompactness]] as suggested by [[loufTypologyStreetPatterns2014]]
- [[Node degree]] as suggested by [[badhrudeenGeometricClassificationWorld2022]] and [[chanUrbanRoadNetworks2011]]
- [[Average node distance]]

#### Possible features:
[[Amount of main road-highway changes]]
[[Amount of street-main road changes]]
[[Path continuity]]
[[Angle continuity]]
[[Circuity]]
[[Clustering coefficient]]
[[Accessibility]]
[[Percentage of tree-like-appendixes]]
[[Road Density]]
[[Betweenness centrality]]
[[Local angle uniformity]]
[[Global angle uniformity]]
[[Intersection angle distribution]]

#### Notes
[[loufTypologyStreetPatterns2014]] argues that blocks are much better suited for classification than the street network, because:
1. There is no unambiguous geometric definition of a street
2. The block shapes determine our perception of a city more than the actual street geometry

[[badhrudeenGeometricClassificationWorld2022]] shows how universal patterns can be discovered. This paper shows that every city, no matter where or when, has an average of around 1.33 links per node.
