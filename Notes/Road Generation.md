# Road generation

#### Experiments:
[[All roads generation experiment population based]]
[[Main roads experiment]]

#### Ideas
[[Road generation strategy]]
[[Joining different parts of the street network]]
[[Learning based road networks]]
[[Smooth curves]]
- Once highways, main roads are done generating, redundant ones can be eliminated based on [[Betweenness centrality]] compared against the centrality of real life roads of that class

#### Important features
- [[Intersection angle distribution]] for branching angle
- [[Global angle uniformity]] for branching angle
- [[Local angle uniformity]] for branching angle
- [[Clustering coefficient]] branching probability and perhaps snapping distance
- [[Circuity]] branching angle
- [[Angle continuity]] branching angle
#### Non-chosen alternatives
- [ ] reasons
- [[Example based generation]]
