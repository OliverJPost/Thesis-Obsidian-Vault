# Road classes
#### Current idea:
1. Highway
2. Primary road (most important roads that are not highways)
3. Secondary road (roads with medium importance and centrality) (Together with primary road, encloses a ==quarter==)
4. Street (Final part of getting to your destination) (Encloses a ==block==) (Can also be pedestrian!)
5. Leaf (Either short dead end streets, or streets that enclose an area smaller than a threshold) (If it encloses an area, the enclosed area is a ==Parcel==) (Could be determined by super low centrality)
