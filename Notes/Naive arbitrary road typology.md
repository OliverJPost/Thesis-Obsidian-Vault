## Naive arbitrary typology
#### Irregular grid
- ![[CleanShot 2024-01-24 at 15.32.22@2x.png]]
- Identifiers: Angles, path continuity, block area distribution, block shape distribution
- Configurables: Block area distribution, block shape distribution, density, ability to slowly “curve”

#### Regular Grid
- ![[image 2.png]]
- Identifiers: Angles, path continuity, length distribution, block area distribution
- Configurables: Length ratio, density, ability to slowly “curve”

#### Organic (perhaps has subcategories)
![[CleanShot 2024-01-24 at 15.47.39@2x.png]]
- Identifiers: Angles, block shape distribution, node degree
- Configurables: “Organicness” and probably lots more

#### Forest (within quarter)
Literature: “Lollipops on a stick” and also “Loops and lollipops”

![[CleanShot 2024-01-24 at 16.07.27@2x.png]]
- Identifiers: Dead ends (node degree)
- Configurables: Angles, length distribution

#### Spaghetti (within quarter)
Literature: “Warped parallel”
-![[image 3.png]]
- ![[image 4.png]]
- Identifiers: Curviness, local angle uniformity
- Configurables: local angle uniformity

### Combination examples
#### Example: Regular Orthogonal grid streets with more organic primary/secondary roads
