Make/use a procedural road network generator that has a lot of parameters. Also make indicators that describe a particular road network (might have to be subdivided in to regions as different road layouts in different parts).

Use these indicators on real cities (OSM) to train the parameters to become as close as possible to that city profile. Then save these parameters as a template.

Idea came while reading [[groenewegenProceduralCityLayout]] thesis, specifically "Land Use Generation" part. This thesis does not specifically mention this method though, it's my own thought.

The same principle could be used for land use generation.
