Based on analysis all over the world derive districts that have a similar road layout. Then use clustering to derive district profiles. Afterwards city profiles can become much more human readable:

Memphis:
Downtown: 80% American full grid. Parameters: (Road entropy, 20%, block size: 40m)
20% Industrial lot grid. Parameters(...)
Suburbs: 70% American grid suburb ....
20% American curvilinear suburb
