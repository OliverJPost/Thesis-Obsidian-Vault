Edges constitute street segments while vi “hanges in the geometry as well as any other property of that se he sake of readability, while our road networks are modeled a yraphs, arrows representing the directions will be omitted in i ions. or the depiction of the terrain and land uses, a discrete, grid-lik he dynamics of the system. This is specially true in an agent-I ing interactions with such environment. solve this problem by treating those two elements as indepenc coupled only by the shared coordinate system that enables the > from each cell to the network. That way, we can compute th the network from cells ¢; to c;, where 7 # j, as: ci ¢ c;) =tn(c) + dpei, ') + Dijkstra(es, e) + dpes, ) Veei Ve<i ere for a given edge e, v, is the speed limit in the street segm e. We start by defining e“ and e as the edges of the network ! c; respectively. Taking an arbitrary edge e, we also define the rce and target nodes. By doing so, we are able to split the trave iponents like shown in Figure 2: the time spent going from th , tiv(c;), then travelling from the closest point in the network | of the edge which p,, lies on, e;*. After that, we use the length t segments to define the weight of the network edges as the kstra algorithm to compute the shortest path between e;* and - edge closest to the destination cell, ¢;. Finally, just like the 1 form ey’ to c; is calculated and we obtain the travel time for g all parts.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":"eng"}
