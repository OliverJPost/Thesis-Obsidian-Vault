The color of the dots indicates in which group the city falls, as defined on Fig 5. On the bottom of the map, the pie charts display the relative importance of the different groups per continent for cities in our dataset (Group 1: 0.8%, Group 2: 20.9%, Group 3: 77.5%, Group 4: 0.8%). We see that the group 3, composed of cities with blocks of various shapes and a slight predominance of larger areas is by far the most represented group in the world.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":"eng"}
